### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
As a backend web developer with three years of experience, I have honed my expertise in server-side programming and database management. I am well-versed in languages such as **Python** and J**avascript** and have extensive experience in developing and maintaining complex web applications using `Flask`, `Django` and `FastAPI`. My ability to work efficiently and effectively as part of a team has allowed me to collaborate on numerous successful projects, delivering high-quality software on time and within budget. I love developing solutions for real-world problems and want to build a career in development.
